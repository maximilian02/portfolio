      <p>
        Software Development field has evolved to something pretty big these days. It's easy to detect how much we need mobile applications on our life or also large scale systems to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each day, since the beginning, I'm dedicated on learning something new about development. Even things that indirectly we need to know about, like human resources related knowledge. Because every co-worker that we have is human, right ? And that's why I've developed my analytical thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides of this, don't get me wrong but I don't believe it's enough with common analytical thinking in my daily work. I'm a convinced person thinking that creativity it's a gate to change the world. And I know I don't have to be a genius to be creative, I believe it's something that you can improve. And that's what I'm doing; increasing my creativity to enhance my code and developing a better way to think in big.
