          Events.com has a very innovative product that allows simple users to create and manage any Event, from
          creation, loading content or even participant registrations. Besides of the size of this project it's easy to use.

            I worked in a project helping to develop new features for the version 6 of the official site. The solution implemented consists in a CMS that holds and manages all the content that administrators want to load and then the client side gets all the data to simply show this like a traditional site. This solution allows to manage each section of the site from the CMS and show everything on the frontend.

            BattleFrog is a brand new OCR mud run series, designed and operated by current and former Navy Seals.

            I developed the frontend side from scratch to consume data from a CMS and allow administrators to show all the content through the site.

            The goal of this project was solve a problem caused by a bad design of User Experience in the Animals section. They have a lot of content to show and based on data analytics the average user leave the site after 2 clicks. My team composed by a UX designer and me was in charge of develop a prototype to solve this problem. We develop succesfully the prototype analysing data like user archetypes to know how the prototype needs to perform to accomplish the users needs.
