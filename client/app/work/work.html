        I worked in a project helping to develop new features for the version 6 of the official site. The solution implemented consists in a CMS that holds and manages all the content that administrators want to load and then the client side gets all the data to simply show this like a traditional site. This solution allows to manage each section of the site from the CMS and show everything on the frontend.

          The goal of this project was solve a problem caused by a bad design of User Experience in the Animals section. They have a lot of content to show and based on data analytics the average user leave the site after 2 clicks. My team composed by a UX designer and me, was in charge of develop a prototype to solve this problem. We develop succesfully the prototype analysing data like user archetypes to know how the prototype needs to perform to accomplish the users needs.
