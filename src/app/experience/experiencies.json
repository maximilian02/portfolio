They allowed me to advocate javascript using ajax to decrease the number of reloads a page would suffer because of the PHP native actions being sent using forms. We added dynamism using javascript vanilla with some jquery work. While taking subjects at university and digging into database modeling, I've had a chance to start modeling and normalizing MySQL databases. I could analyze a problem at work and then design a solution using entity diagrams, adding some normalization and finally, implement it.",
